EDA_with_Pandas.ipynb: 

This Jupyter Notebook contains a step-by-step guide on performing EDA with Pandas. 
It covers data loading, data cleaning, data visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

## Dataset Details

- **File Name**: [telecom_churn.csv]
- **File Format**: [CSV]

In this project, we performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the Pandas library in Python. Here are some of the key Pandas functions and methods used for EDA:

- `pd.read_csv()`:        Used to read the dataset from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
- `.head()`:       Used to display the first few rows of the dataset.
- `.info()`:      Used to get information about the dataset, including data types and missing values.
- `.describe()`:     Used to generate summary statistics of numeric columns.
- `.value_counts()`:      Used to count the occurrences of unique values in categorical columns.
- `.groupby()`: Used to group data by a specific column for aggregation.
- `.plot()`:     Used to create various plots and visualizations, such as bar plots and histograms.


These Pandas functions and methods helped us gain insights into the dataset, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.
